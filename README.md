# Solo Level System 🗡️  
**A Personal Project Inspired by the *System* from [Solo Leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Leveling)**

---

## Overview
Solo Level System is a full-stack web application built to make daily work feel more structured. Each day starts fresh. Users add quests, complete them, gain XP, level up, and spend stat points. Stats directly affect how much time future quests are allowed to take.

The app is designed around starting and finishing a day on purpose rather than keeping long running task lists.

---

## Core Concept
The system follows a simple loop:

- Each day is its own session  
- Tasks are treated as quests  
- Completing quests gives XP  
- XP leads to level ups  
- Level ups give stat points  
- Stats affect future quest limits  

Progress is shown through numbers and through changes in the interface.

---

## Authentication & Accounts
Users create accounts with a username and password. Authentication uses JSON Web Tokens and stays active across sessions.

**Auth form (login and register)**

Each account keeps its own progression data, templates, and daily history in MongoDB.

---

## Daily System
A day must be started before any quests can be added.

**Day not started**  
![Day not started](./screenshots/day-not-started.png)

**Day started (active dashboard)**  
![Day started](./screenshots/day-started.png)

- A day can only be started once  
- Quests belong to a single day  
- At midnight Toronto time, the day resets  
- A new day must be started after reset  

---

## Core Dashboard: Quests, XP, and Stats
Once the day is active, everything happens in one place.

**Quest creation and save as template option**  
![Quest creation](./screenshots/quest-create.png)

- Quests have a title, category, and duration  
- Quests can be saved as templates  
- XP and stat totals are always visible  

**Quest added to active list**

## Quest Completion Feedback
When a quest is completed, the system responds right away.

**Quest completion without level up**  
![Quest completion](./screenshots/quest-complete.png)

**Quest completion with level up**  
![Quest completion with level up](./screenshots/quest-complete-levelup.png)

The feedback shows XP gained, level ups, and updated stat totals.

---

## Leveling & Stat Allocation
XP fills a bar toward the next level. Leveling up grants stat points that can be spent manually.

**Stat points and allocation panel**  
![Stats panel](./screenshots/stats.png)

Higher stats increase the maximum minutes allowed for quests in that category.

---

## Templates System
Repeated quests can be saved and reused.

**Templates panel**

Templates stay available across days and make setup faster.

---

## Level-Based UI Progression
Visual changes unlock gradually as the user levels up rather than being available from the start.

### Low-Level UI (10+)
![Low level UI](./screenshots/ui-low-level.png)

- Minimal effects and a static background  

### Mid-Level UI (20+)
![Mid level UI](./screenshots/ui-mid-level.png)

- Subtle background motion  
- Increased visual depth  

### High-Level UI (30+)
![High level UI](./screenshots/ui-high-level.png)

- Dynamic background effects  
- Cursor-based lighting that reacts to movement  
- Visual feedback tied directly to progression

## Notes
- Daily reset runs automatically at midnight Toronto time  
- Quest time limits are calculated from stored stat values  
- XP and stat updates are validated on the server  
- Cursor-based effects activate only at higher levels  
- Authentication tokens are stored client side and verified on each request
